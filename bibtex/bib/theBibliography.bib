  abstract     = {The collection of vehicular tolls at Port Authority tunnels and bridges is one of the most important operations conducted by the police personnel. More than 250 traffic officers are utilized, and the payroll costs exceed a million dollars annually. In staffing its toll plazas the Port Authority attempts to handle traffic with a minimum number of toll collectors consistent with uniformly good service to the public and properly spaced relief periods for the toll collectors. This requires finding the level of traffic delays that gives the best compromise between the conflicting objectives of economy and service. In the past the number of toll collectors provided for operating a toll plaza was determined by judgment based on experience and a rule-of-thumb work standard which had not been related to service. Judgment was likewise used to allocate manpower and control the number of toll booths opened at any time. This method resulted in patron delays observed to vary from 2 to 50 sec. The tools of probability theory provide methods for dealing with the problem in quantitative terms. They enable determination of the relations between traffic volumes, number of toll booths, and grade of service. With this knowledge the optimum grade of service can be established in a logical manner and the number of toll booths required at any time of day can be specified in advance. Use of this method permitted savings in toll collection expenses and better service.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.}

Some of the promising directions for elaborating these innovations in the future may be viewed from a framework that links the perspectives of artificial intelligence and operations research.

This problem often integrates employee timetabling and production scheduling. The employee timetabling problem is addressed in the context of skill requirements and under availability and legislative constraints. The production scheduling is considered as a re-entrant hybrid job-shop problem with time lags and sequence dependent setup times, under machine availability constraints. The objective is to minimize the labor cost, while respecting a maximum makespan and a maximum tardiness constraints. Two different models and exact resolution methods are proposed, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP). Numerical experimentations are conducted to compare and evaluate their performances, based on randomly generated instances. The results show that the CP model is slower than the MILP model in terms of finding optimal solutions forlarge instances, but is more efficient in generating feasible solutions. Thus, providing a feasible initial solution to the MILP model using the CP model is a promising hybrid approach to reduce the computational time.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a variation of the air traffic controller (ATC) work shift scheduling problem focusing on the tactical phase, in which the plan for the day of operations can be modified according to real-time traffic demand or other possible incidents (one or more ATCs become sick and/or there is an increase in unplanned air traffic), which may lead to a new sectorization and a lower number of available ATCs. To deal with these issues, we must reassign the available ATCs to the new sectorization established at the time the incident happens, but also taking into account the work done by the ATCs up to that point. We propose a new methodology consisting of two phases. The goal of the first phase is to build an initial possibly infeasible solution, taking into account the sectors that have been closed or opened in the new sectorization, together with the ATCs available after the incident. In the second phase, we use simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristics to derive a feasible solution in which the available ATCs are used and all the ATC labor conditions are met. A weighted additive objective function is used in this phase to account for the feasibility of the solution but also for the number of changes in the control center at the time the incident happens and the similarity of the derived solution with templates usually used by the network manager operations center, a center managing the air traffic flows of an entire network of control centers. The methodology is illustrated by means of seven real instances provided by the Air Traffic Management Research, Development and Innovation Reference Center (CRIDA) experts representing possible incidents that may arise. The solutions derived by SA outperform those reached by VNS in terms of both the number of violated constraints in all seven instances, and solution compactability in six out the seven instances, and both are very similar with regard to the number of control center changes at the time of the incident. Although computation times for VNS are clearly better than for SA, CRIDA experts were satisfied with SA computation times. The solutions reached by SA were preferred.},

  abstract     = {We address an air traffic control operator (ATCo) work-shift scheduling problem. We consider a multiple objective perspective where the number of ATCos is fixed in advance and a set of ATCo labor conditions have to be satisfied. The objectives deal with the ATCo work and rest periods and positions, the structure of the solution, the number of control center changes, or the distribution of the ATCo workloads. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology. In the first phase, a heuristic is used to derive infeasible initial solutions on the basis of templates. Then, a multiple independent run of the simulated annealing metaheuristic is conducted aimed at reaching feasible solutions in the second phase. Finally, a multiple independent simulated annealing run is again conducted from the initial feasible solutions to optimize the objective functions. To do this, we transform the multiple to single optimization problem by using the rank-order centroid function. In the search processes in phases 2 and 3, we use regular expressions to check the ATCo labor conditions in the visited solutions. This provides high testing speed. The proposed approach is illustrated using a real example, and the optimal solution which is reached outperforms an existing template-based reference solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with the air traffic controller (ATCo) work shift scheduling problem. This is a multi-objective optimization problem, as it involves identifying the best possible distribution of ATCo work and rest periods and positions, ATCo workload and control center changes in order to cover an airspace sector configuration, while, at the same time, complying with ATCo working conditions. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) to tackle this problem. The solution structure should resemble the previous template-based solution. Initial infeasible solutions are built using a template-based heuristic in Phase 1. Then, VNS is conducted in Phase 2 in order to arrive at a feasible solution. This constitutes the starting point of a new search process carried out in Phase 3 to derive an optimal solution based on a weighted sum fitness function. We analyzed the performance in the proposed methodology of VNS against simulated annealing, as well as the use of regular expressions compared with the implementation in the code to verify the feasibility of the analyzed solutions, taking into account four representative and complex instances of the problem corresponding to different airspace sectorings.},
