  abstract     = {The collection of vehicular tolls at Port Authority tunnels and bridges is one of the most important operations conducted by the police personnel. More than 250 traffic officers are utilized, and the payroll costs exceed a million dollars annually. In staffing its toll plazas the Port Authority attempts to handle traffic with a minimum number of toll collectors consistent with uniformly good service to the public and properly spaced relief periods for the toll collectors. This requires finding the level of traffic delays that gives the best compromise between the conflicting objectives of economy and service. In the past the number of toll collectors provided for operating a toll plaza was determined by judgment based on experience and a rule-of-thumb work standard which had not been related to service. Judgment was likewise used to allocate manpower and control the number of toll booths opened at any time. This method resulted in patron delays observed to vary from 2 to 50 sec. The tools of probability theory provide methods for dealing with the problem in quantitative terms. They enable determination of the relations between traffic volumes, number of toll booths, and grade of service. With this knowledge the optimum grade of service can be established in a logical manner and the number of toll booths required at any time of day can be specified in advance. Use of this method permitted savings in toll collection expenses and better service.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.}

Some of the promising directions for elaborating these innovations in the future may be viewed from a framework that links the perspectives of artificial intelligence and operations research.

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a real manufacturing scheduling problem that is particularly encountered in the tannery industries. This problem often integrates employee timetabling and production scheduling. The employee timetabling problem is addressed in the context of skill requirements and under availability and legislative constraints. The production scheduling is considered as a re-entrant hybrid job-shop problem with time lags and sequence dependent setup times, under machine availability constraints. The objective is to minimize the labor cost, while respecting a maximum makespan and a maximum tardiness constraints. Two different models and exact resolution methods are proposed, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming (CP). Numerical experimentations are conducted to compare and evaluate their performances, based on randomly generated instances. The results show that the CP model is slower than the MILP model in terms of finding optimal solutions forlarge instances, but is more efficient in generating feasible solutions. Thus, providing a feasible initial solution to the MILP model using the CP model is a promising hybrid approach to reduce the computational time.},
