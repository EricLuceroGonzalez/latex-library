  abstract     = {Fatigue is one of the most important issues since it is considered to be a potential risk factor for human error. Most research related to human fatigue in the aviation industry targets pilots, yet air traffic controllers also experience elevated levels of fatigue that affects aviation safety. Despite this, fatigue is often ignored in literature, as it is a mental and physical status that is difficult to measure. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced the concept of the Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS) in Annex 6 in 2011, which provides suggestions to reduce aircrew fatigue. In 2016, the Civil Air Navigation Services Organization (CANSO), ICAO, and the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers’ Associations (IFATCA) published the Fatigue Management Guide for Air Traffic Service Providers and for the first time proposed recommendations for air traffic controllers (ATCs) to address this issue. Based on the management guide, this research used the Samn-Perelli fatigue scale to measure air traffic controllers’ fatigue levels in an international aerodrome control tower in Taiwan. The results indicated that there were significant differences between day/night shifts, time periods (shift start time, before break time, after break time, and shift end time), and various work schedules. The results also revealed the importance of the timing of the breaks and time on task when arranging work schedules. This research contributes to aviation safety by investigating ATCs’ fatigue levels in current work shifts, thereby helping related units to improve and adjust shift schedules in order to reduce the risks related to fatigue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract     = {This meta-review synthesises the literature on air transport research. It focuses on human operators as portrayed in systematic reviews. It aims to identify key trends and suggest future research. Most air transport research has focused on passengers, the environment, and economics. Yet, research on human operators, particularly pilots and air traffic controllers, has lagged. This study fills this gap. It is the first meta-review of human operators in air transport. A comprehensive search, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, was done across databases, including Scopus and Google Scholar. The search revealed 588 records, with 41 systematic reviews meeting the inclusion criteria. We synthesised data along three dimensions: context, methods and themes. The review found a growing body of research, especially post-2019. It had significant contributions from Australia, the USA, and the UK. The studies focused on pilots and cabin crew. They addressed mental health, fatigue, and job risks. Methodological rigour was high, with PRISMA guidelines being followed consistently. The findings show a growing interest in human operators in air transport. We propose future reviews to focus on airport ground operators and workforce diversity. Integrating human operators into systems theories could optimise air transport systems. It would make better use of both human and technological resources.},

  abstract     = {Fatigue remains a critical contributor to human error in Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems, posing significant risks to aviation safety. The mentally demanding nature of ATC tasks, particularly during transitions from automated to manual control, intensifies the challenges associated with fatigue. While existing fatigue detection methods are broadly categorized into behavioral, physiological, and subjective approaches, there is limited understanding on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being utilized in this context. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review of 105 peer-reviewed studies, focusing on both technological and human-centric dimensions of fatigue management in ATC. The review explores key advancements in fatigue detection strategies, including the development of reliable data collection platforms, refined feature classification techniques, and the use of simulation-based assessments. It further highlights the potential of AI to enhance traditional human factors frameworks by enabling a more integrated approach that balances human adaptability with automated support. Ultimately, this review provides actionable insights for both academia and industry, offering a comprehensive foundation for evolving fatigue risk management practices in alignment with Industry 5.0′s emphasis on human-centric automation. © 2025},

  abstract     = {With the growing density of air passenger traffic, accurately recognizing the level of mental fatigue (MF) experienced by air traffic controllers (ATCOs) is crucial for developing intelligent ATCOs' mental state monitoring systems, which can achieve a more effective and safer human–machine cooperative pattern. However, the existing methods for recognizing ATCOs' MF face significant challenges due to pattern variations between ATCOs and sensor artifacts. This study introduces a framework for ATCOs' MF recognition, utilizing a deep neural network called RecMF, which incorporates multi-sensor information fusion to enhance the performance of MF detection. Specifically, the RecMF employs an attention-enabled CNN-LSTM architecture that simultaneously captures time-series feature representations of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and eye movements. To validate the effectiveness of RecMF, a fatigue-inducing experiment is conducted involving 28 subjects who are tasked with performing a series of air traffic control (ATC) tasks. The model's performance is evaluated across various time horizons and typical cognitive tasks to gain insights into its capabilities. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other existing methods, thereby confirming its feasibility and effectiveness. Additionally, the effects of MF on ATCOs' cognitive performance are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results reveal that higher levels of MF significantly reduce ATCOs' reaction speed and operational accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The proper planning of a shift schedule requires consideration of at least three elements: the specific characteristics of the controller task, the physiological needs of the operator, and the definition of rest periods within rostering. We reviewed the literature for providing comprehensive guidance on the main requirements for the construction of a shift schedule for ATCOs. Our considerations are organized according to a rationale reflecting the most important criteria for the construction of the schedule: namely, the organization of rest periods conceptualized as intervals between cycles of shifts, intervals between individual shifts, and breaks within the shift. The suggested parameters could be used to construct shift schedules within a variation margin that depends on individual contexts of application. © 2022 by the authors.

The objective of ATM is to ensure safe and efficient flights, from departure to arrival. This mission is carried out by a number of national or international organizations that provide different services to the airspace users. Flights can be separated into two categories, depending on the level of equipment of the aircraft and level of qualification of the pilots. A flight may operate under visual flight rules (VFR) or instrumental flight rules (IFR). Several classes of airspace (from A to G) determine which services are provided to which types of flight. A key issue for air traffic safety is to avoid overloading air traffic controllers. The chapter also briefly describes the different measures and procedures that aim at avoiding overloads while trying to match capacity and demand as much as possible.},

The trainee must apply all theoretical knowledge concerning the separation rules decreed by ICAO to resolve a traffic situation presenting a certain number of conflicts generated by a group of aircraft (A/C). At the end of his performance, the solution proposed by the trainee is compared to that of the instructor or that generated by a control simulator. For a trainee wishing to train in the absence of an instructor or simulator, it is useful to offer them a simple tool that can provide an optimized solution. Thus, the use of metaheuristics in this tool is recommended and the challenge revolves around two main objectives, eliminating the risk of collisions between A/C while minimizing changes to initial flight plans. Regarding previous work, where genetic algorithms and simulated annealing were used to the problem, we present a comparison an analyse of the results obtained for both principals objectives by this two algorithms through a series of tests on exercises inspired by real practical work.  © 2024 IEEE.},

Additional assignments include a 30-minute lunch break and several 15-minute rest breaks within each shift. The goal is to select the minimum number of employees that balances a weighted combination of demand undercoverage, overcoverage and labor costs. Additional constraints include the minimum/maximum number of employees, minimum shift and demand coverage, minimum number of consecutive working hours, bounds on working hours, minimum days off, maximum consecutive days on, and minimum rest time between shifts. A 2-phase algorithm is developed to efficiently construct weekly schedules for the controllers. In Phase 1, employee-shift assignments are made with a randomization algorithm and a greedy post-processor. In Phase 2, 15-minute breaks are added to the selected shifts by solving a second optimization model. The proposed methodology is tested on both small instances defined by the Federal Aviation Administration in their 2022 challenge, and large instances with up to 52 employees. Compared to the actual schedule, the results verify that the 2-phase algorithm offers significantly better schedules with respect to all metrics. We conclude with a parametric analysis of the number of employees to determine how staffing levels effect solution quality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

We study the impact of various weather phenomena on air traffic controller (ATCO) taskload through structured interviews with ATCOs. We deduce taskload-driven impact factors and the corresponding thresholds for the intensity of the weather phenomena at several Swedish airports. To account for the uncertainty in the weather prediction, we obtain probabilistic weather data from Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPSs). Then we adjust our prior Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for RTC staff scheduling to account for uncertain impactful weather occurrences and yield a distribution for the necessary number of ATCOs for RTC staff scheduling. Our framework can be used for conventional towers as well. We quantify the impact of weather by comparing the number of controllers necessary to operate at five Swedish airports from a remote tower during two example days in 2020, with and without taking weather events into account. In our calculations we use historical weather and flight data to show that ignoring weather impact may lead to significant understaffing at a RTC. © 2022 The Author(s)},

We propose a new methodology consisting of two phases. The goal of the first phase is to build an initial possibly infeasible solution, taking into account the sectors that have been closed or opened in the new sectorization, together with the ATCos available after the incident. In the second phase, we use the simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristics to derive a feasible solution in which the available ATCos are used and all the ATCo labor conditions are met. A weight additive objective function is used in this phase to account for the feasibility of the solution but also for the number of changes in the control center at the time the incident happens and the similarity of the derived solution with templates usually used by the network manager operations center. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract     = {This paper deals with a variation of the air traffic controller (ATC) work shift scheduling problem focusing on the tactical phase, in which the plan for the day of operations can be modified according to real-time traffic demand or other possible incidents (one or more ATCs become sick and/or there is an increase in unplanned air traffic), which may lead to a new sectorization and a lower number of available ATCs. To deal with these issues, we must reassign the available ATCs to the new sectorization established at the time the incident happens, but also taking into account the work done by the ATCs up to that point. We propose a new methodology consisting of two phases. The goal of the first phase is to build an initial possibly infeasible solution, taking into account the sectors that have been closed or opened in the new sectorization, together with the ATCs available after the incident. In the second phase, we use simulated annealing (SA) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristics to derive a feasible solution in which the available ATCs are used and all the ATC labor conditions are met. A weighted additive objective function is used in this phase to account for the feasibility of the solution but also for the number of changes in the control center at the time the incident happens and the similarity of the derived solution with templates usually used by the network manager operations center, a center managing the air traffic flows of an entire network of control centers. The methodology is illustrated by means of seven real instances provided by the Air Traffic Management Research, Development and Innovation Reference Center (CRIDA) experts representing possible incidents that may arise. The solutions derived by SA outperform those reached by VNS in terms of both the number of violated constraints in all seven instances, and solution compactability in six out the seven instances, and both are very similar with regard to the number of control center changes at the time of the incident. Although computation times for VNS are clearly better than for SA, CRIDA experts were satisfied with SA computation times. The solutions reached by SA were preferred.},

  abstract   = {Weather affects the work of air traffic controllers, however, for staff scheduling in Remote Tower Centers (RTCs) it has not been taken into account. In this paper, we study the impact of different weather phenomena on air traffic controller (ATCO) taskload through structured interviews with ATCOs, and deduce taskload-driven impact factors and thresholds for the intensity of different weather phenomena at different Swedish airports above which a weather phenomena influences an ATCO’s work significantly. Using probabilistic weather modeling, we compute the probability of the occurrence of any of these impactful weather phenomena at an airport. We extend our prior Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to account for impactful weather occurrences and yield a distribution for the necessary number of ATCOs for RTC staff scheduling. We present experimental results for five Swedish airports (which are either already operated remotely or considered for future remote operation). We show that taking impactful weather into account increases the number of necessary controllers, compared to planning for “optimal” conditions. © 2020 IADIS. All rights reserved.},

This new concept fundamentally changes how operators provide Air Traffic Services, as it becomes possible to control several airports from a single remote center. In such settings an air traffic controller works at a so-called “multiple position” at the Remote Tower Center (RTC), which means that he/she can handle two or more airports from one Remote Tower Module (controller working position). In this paper, we present an optimization framework designed for automation of staff planning at the RTC.

  abstract     = {Shift scheduling is a critical task in workforce management, which consists of covering the staffing needs by feasible work shifts at minimum labor cost. Work shifts must include rest breaks according to national regulations and collective agreements, significantly impacting the expected Level of Service (LoS) provided to the customers. Therefore, managers tend to preserve the LoS by rigidly scheduling breaks at a centralized level. This affects the well-being of employees, who, especially in large organizations, require more discretion in choosing rest breaks to reduce work stress. This paper presents a two-stage robust optimization model with decision-dependent uncertainty to handle discretionary break assignment. This is a challenging problem both in theory and practice. We formulate it as a bilevel program and develop a tailored heuristic algorithm to find high-quality shift schedules for staffing patterns of several service systems. This methodology allows managers to assess the cost of discretion and to finely determine the best trade-off among discretion, LoS, and labor cost.},

  abstract     = {The process of staff planning and rostering is one of the key factors affecting the performance of an Air Navigation Service Provider in terms of capacity and cost-efficiency delivered to airspace users. This paper gives a summary of previous works and current rostering practices applied at Area Control Centres (ACCs) in Europe. Furthermore, it identifies key trade-offs between rostering flexibility, capacity and productivity by establishing a relationship between ACC demand, rostering flexibility in place and the number of Air Traffic Control Officers (ATCOs) needed, as well as by exploring how varying rostering practices applied in ACCs affect spare capacity in the system. To that end, an initial mathematical model for optimizing ATCO staffing requirements has been proposed and tested on a case study involving three representative ACCs, reflecting different hourly variability in demand. The results suggest that - for different combinations of shift patterns and capacity profiles - substantial variation exists in both the minimum number of ATCOs and the associated spare ACC capacity. It has also been shown that a certain amount of spare capacity is inevitably present in the system due to inability to perfectly match ATCO hours with demand. Different options and enablers for exploiting such capacity are also discussed in the paper. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The problem is solved by using SAT, MaxSAT, PB, SMT, CSP and ILP solvers. In combination with these solvers, three different optimization techniques are presented, a basic technique and its two modifications. The modifications use local search to modify some parts of the initial solution. Results indicate that SAT-related approaches outperform other solving methods used and that one of the introduced techniques which uses local search can significantly outperform the basic technique. We have successfully used these approaches to make shift schedules for one air traffic control center. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

We consider a multiple objective perspective where the number of ATCos is fixed in advance and a set of ATCo labor conditions have to be satisfied. The objectives deal with the ATCo work and rest periods and positions, the structure of the solution, the number of control center changes, or the distribution of the ATCo workloads. We propose a three-phase problem-solving methodology. In the first phase, a heuristic is used to derive infeasible initial solutions on the basis of templates. Then, a multiple independent run of the simulated annealing metaheuristic is conducted aimed at reaching feasible solutions in the second phase. Finally, a multiple independent simulated annealing run is again conducted from the initial feasible solutions to optimize the objective functions. To do this, we transform the multiple to single optimization problem by using the rank-order centroid function. In the search processes in phases 2 and 3, we use regular expressions to check the ATCo labor conditions in the visited solutions. This provides high testing speed. The proposed approach is illustrated using a real example, and the optimal solution which is reached outperforms an existing template-based reference solution.},

This constitutes the starting point of a new search process carried out in Phase 3 to derive an optimal solution based on a weighted sum fitness function.
