  abstract     = {The general employee scheduling problem extends the standard shift scheduling problem by discarding key limitations such as employee homogeneity and the absence of connections across time period blocks. The resulting increased generality yields a scheduling model that applies to real world problems confronted in a wide variety of areas. The price of the increased generality is a marked increase in size and complexity over related models reported in the literature. The integer programming formulation for the general employee scheduling problem, arising in typical real world settings, contains from one million to over four million zero-one variables. By contrast, studies of special cases reported over the past decade have focused on problems involving between 100 and 500 variables. We characterize the relationship between the general employee scheduling problem and related problems, reporting computational results for a procedure that solves these more complex problems within 98–99\% optimality and runs on a microcomputer. We view our approach as an integration of management science and artificial intelligence techniques. The benefits of such an integration are suggested by the fact that other zero-one scheduling implementations reported in the literature, including the one awarded the Lancaster Prize in 1984, have obtained comparable approximations of optimality only for problems from two to three orders of magnitude smaller, and then only by the use of large mainframe computers.},

  abstract     = {The timetabling problem consists in scheduling a sequence of lectures between teachers and students in a prefixed period of time (typically a week), satisfying a set of constraints of various types. A large number of variants of the timetabling problem have been proposed in the literature, which differ from each other based on the type of institution involved (university or school) and the type of constraints. This problem, that has been traditionally considered in the operational research field, has recently been tackled with techniques belonging also to Artificial Intelligence (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search, and constraint satisfaction). In this paper, we survey the various formulations of the problem, and the techniques and algorithms used for its solution.},

  abstract     = {We find personnel rostering problems all around us, in different industries and with varying purposes. Personnel rostering problems have multiple stakeholders, i.e., employers, employees, and customers, all with unique viewpoints. Hence, personnel rostering problems have an inherent multi-objective structure, as the quality of a solution is determined by evaluating multiple conflicting criteria simultaneously. Most of the published research into personnel rostering problems apply weighted sum scalarization, followed by single-objective optimization. A number of alternative methods exist for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. These methods preserve the underlying multi-objective structure and aim to assist a decision maker in finding their most preferred solution when considering all the objectives. In this article, we review 52 papers that have presented multi-objective optimization methods for personnel rostering problems since the year 2000. We categorize these papers by drawing upon how they incorporate the decision maker’s preferences and which profession they consider. We present common trends in the literature, draw out unexplored areas, and provide recommendations for future researchers.},

We have concentrated upon university timetabling but we believe that some of the methodologies that are described can be used for different timetabling problems such as employee timetabling, timetabling of sports fixtures, etc. The paper suggests a number of approaches and comprises three parts. Firstly, recent heuristic and evolutionary timetabling algorithms are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments are described: a method for decomposing large real-world timetabling problems and a method for heuristic initialisation of the population. Secondly, an approach that considers timetabling problems as multicriteria decision problems is presented. Thirdly, we discuss a case-based reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve new timetabling problems. Finally, we outline some new research ideas and directions in the field of timetabling. The overall aim of these research directions is to explore approaches that can operate at a higher level of generality than is currently possible.},

On the other hand, many managerial studies give an extensive description of the human implications of certain management decisions in particular cases, but fail to provide useful mathematical models to solve workforce planning problems. This review will guide the operations researcher in his search to find useful papers and information regarding workforce planning problems incorporating skills. We not only discuss the differences and similarities between different papers, but we also give an overview of the managerial insights.

It provides a comprehensive review of the latest solution methodologies, particularly computational intelligence (CI) approaches, utilized in benchmark and real-world nurse rostering. The methodologies are systematically categorised (Heuristics, Meta-heuristics, Hyper-heuristics, Mathematical Optimisation, Matheuristics and Hybrid Approaches). The NRP benchmark repositories and the respective state-of-the-art methods are also presented. A distinctive feature of this survey is its focus on the emerging trends in terms of solution methodologies and benchmark datasets. Meta-heuristics are the most popular choices in addressing NRP. Matheuristics, one of most popular methodologies in addressing the NRP, has been an emerging trend in recent years (2018 onwards). The INRC-I dataset is the most popular benchmark currently in use by researchers to test their algorithms. An in-depth discussion on the challenges and research opportunities is provided. The summary and analysis of the recently published NRP methodological papers in this survey is valuable for the CI and Operational Research (OR) communities especially early career researchers seeking to find gaps and identify emerging trends in this fast-developing, important research area.},

It considers nurses with different skills, special shifts depending on the skills, time work-load limits, and different types of days-off. In addition, preferences and incompatibilities between nurses are taken into account. We propose a MIP model and a local search method, driven by a Simulated Annealing metaheuristic, based on a combination of two neighborhoods. The solution method was tested on 34 real-world instances coming from various healthcare institutions in North Italy.

  abstract     = {Nurse rostering is the process of scheduling hospital nurses for a certain period of time. This is a complex and interesting task that involves multiple perspectives, including those of the hospital, nurses, and patients. In addition, nurse scheduling must consider existing constraints to obtain a schedule that is close to optimal. Common constraints include the number of available nurses, their abilities, labor regulations, and hospital policies. The numerous constraints in nurse scheduling lead to a problem known as the Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP), which is difficult to solve conventionally and is considered an NP-hard problem. Many researchers have attempted to solve NRP computationally, as this approach reduces the time required to create nurse schedules. The less time needed to create nurse schedules, the more time can be allocated to improving medical services, which ultimately impacts the quality of healthcare in the hospital's surrounding area. Several approaches have been used to solve NRP, including hyper-heuristic methods, which are search methods used to solve optimization problems. The aim of this study is to employ a hyper-heuristic approach using Reinforcement Learning - Simulated Annealing with Reheating algorithm to solve the nurse scheduling problem in hospitals in Norway.

  abstract     = {The Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP) is a complex scheduling problem in which nurses must be assigned to shifts according to a set of constraints. The NRP is difficult to solve to optimality due to its combinatorial structure. In this paper, we propose a hybrid solution algorithm that combines Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based heuristics—namely Fix-and-Relax (F\&R) and Fix-and-Optimize (F\&O)—and Simulated Annealing (SA) to solve the NRP. In MIP-based heuristics, a problem is decomposed into a set of smaller problems and each problem is iteratively solved to optimality. In the hybrid approach, high-quality initial solutions are obtained via the F\&R algorithm and fed to the SA part of the algorithm. When solutions can no longer be improved, the F\&O algorithm is inserted into the SA algorithm. This enables the hybrid algorithm to diversify the search space and provide better solutions. To assess the quality and efficiency of the hybrid approach, we use 24 publicly available test instances recently introduced in literature in the field. Computational results show that the hybrid method outperforms other advanced solution techniques in most of the test data and seven new best-known results are reported.},

  abstract     = {Personnel scheduling remains a significant organizational challenge with substantial potential for cost and time savings. Despite extensive research in this domain, few studies have been successfully implemented in practice, and even fewer have gained widespread acceptance among end-users. This gap between research and application often arises from oversimplified real-world models, which may result from subjective solution evaluations or a lack of collaboration between modelers and end-users. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a machine learning-enhanced memetic algorithm (MLMA) that mimics schedules created by experts to solve a highly complex personnel scheduling problem involving multi-skilled workers and flexible shift types (irregular workforce)—a real-world challenge commonly faced in the hospitality sector. By leveraging historical scheduling preferences, the MLMA generates solutions that align with past practices, enhancing their practicality and appeal to end-users. Experiments conducted on real-life instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing real-world problems, where the workforce is predominantly part-time, possesses mixed skills, and requires flexible shifts. Furthermore, the results highlight the MLMA’s ability to identify shift patterns that closely resemble historical schedules, underscoring its potential for practical implementation and its role in bridging the gap between research and real-world application.},

  abstract     = {The airline crew rostering problem (CRP) is significant for balancing the workload of crew and for improving the satisfaction rate of crew’s preferences, which is related to the fairness and satisfaction of crew. However, most existing work considers only one objective on fairness or satisfaction. In this study, we propose a new practical model for CRP that takes both fairness and satisfaction into account simultaneously. To solve the multi-objective CRP efficiently, we develop an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMO) framework, termed multi-objective ACS (MOACS). The main contributions of MOACS lie in three aspects. Firstly, two ant colonies are utilized to optimize fairness and satisfaction objectives, respectively. Secondly, a new hybrid complementary heuristic strategy with three kinds of heuristic information schemes is proposed to avoid ant colonies focusing only on their own objectives. Ant colonies randomly choose one of the three schemes to help explore the Pareto front (PF) sufficiently. Thirdly, a local search strategy with two types of local search respectively for fairness and satisfaction is designed to further approach the global PF. The MOACS is applied to seven real-world monthly CRPs with different sizes from a major North-American airline. Experimental results show that MOACS generally outperforms the greedy algorithm and some other popular multi-objective optimization algorithms, especially on large-scale instances.},

  abstract     = {Even though warehouses are becoming increasingly automated, humans remain their central and most important resource. Every day, various activities must be carried out by workers. The assignment of individual workers to specific tasks has a major impact on the overall efficiency of a warehouse. The problem of finding an efficient assignment is not trivial and is complicated by task durations being unknown in advance, operational constraints, and the fact that employee well-being must be taken into consideration to maintain employee satisfaction. The method proposed in this paper uses work profiles: ordered lists of task properties such as type and work zone. Each worker is assigned exactly one profile and tasks are dynamically allocated to workers based on their profile. Finding a good profile assignment is crucial, yet the profiles are usually assigned manually by shift supervisors. This paper proposes a framework for automating the assignment of profiles to employees under uncertain task durations. The proposed approach applies a metaheuristic algorithm together with discrete-event simulation to evaluate the quality of a solution. The simulation component is used to address uncertainty of the task durations either by considering multiple scenarios or by using mean task durations. Possible values for task durations originate from distributions which are assumed to be given or learned from historical data. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) we propose a profile-assignment framework that deals with uncertainty of the task durations, (2) we study the trade-offs between run time and accuracy within this framework, and (3) we analyze our main design decisions and demonstrate how our method outperforms reconstructed solutions produced by a human expert.},

Employee shift and day-off preferences are also considered to enhance morale. We propose a two-stage integer programming model. In the first stage, the model optimizes the number of employees required for each shift period, ensuring uniform distribution of overstaffing to improve customer service. A Pareto frontier approach is applied between the two stages, offering decision-makers a set of non-dominated solutions that balance overstaffing and understaffing. The second stage uses the selected Pareto-optimal solution to assign shifts and day-offs to employees, incorporating their skills, preferences, and fairness considerations. Our model implicitly includes shifts and breaks, reducing decision variables and computational time. Using real data from a dining restaurant chain, we validate the model’s effectiveness in enhancing customer service and reducing labor costs by 12.3\% compared to manual scheduling. Furthermore, productivity and employee satisfaction improve by considering individual skills and preferences.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the personnel task rescheduling problem with time preemption. We assume a baseline task schedule has been composed some time in advance that has been rendered infeasible due to operational uncertainty. When restoring the schedule feasibility, the personnel planner takes several considerations into account encompassing the provided service level, resource stability, and task adherence. The latter stems from the possibility that in the problem under study tasks can be interrupted and resumed later, better known as time preemption. We propose a genetic algorithm complemented with local search techniques to compose an operational schedule in an effective manner. The genetic algorithm operates on a dedicated decoding mechanism to compose high-quality duties for individual workers efficiently. Computational experiments are conducted to benchmark the performance of the proposed procedure with other exact and (meta-)heuristic solution procedures, and to demonstrate the value of the algorithm design choices. Furthermore, the impact of preempting tasks in time is assessed by changing the objective function structure and the proportion of non-preemptive tasks.},

In this paper, a two-stage approach is proposed to tackle the problem, where the former generates preliminary solutions satisfying all the hard constraints, and the latter refines the solutions by fulfilling soft constraints as much as possible. The proposed approach employs artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm as the main search framework in both stages, and appropriate neighborhood structures are designed respectively. Specifically, in the latter stage, integer programming (IP) employed under several ruin-and-recreate principles is embedded in the ABC algorithm, which helps intensify and diversify solutions. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in achieving good solutions for large-scale problem instances. In addition, we give some guidance on how to weigh various employees’ working preferences and how to balance labor costs and staff satisfaction. Finally, a case study is given to explain how the proposed model and algorithm work for a call center. This study will help call centers make appropriate decisions when planning their employees.},

Despite AI becoming pervasive in most engineering domains, there is a lack of methods that can provide high-quality crew scheduling in the railway industry. To fill this gap, this study designs a railway crew scheduling model of mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem utilizing the bacterial foraging algorithm (BFA) and evaluates the model's advantages and limitations. BFA is a novel class of biologically inspired stochastic global search methodology that is based on E. coli bacteria's foraging behavior. Using the Taiwan Railways dataset, we compare the performance of the proposed BFA-based method for railway crew scheduling optimization (BFARCSO) against two benchmark methods, the genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and showcase its advantages in terms of solution quality and computation time. Finally, a series of computational testing and validation highlights the efficiency and superiority of BFARCSO. It demonstrates that this approach significantly improves the large-scale railway crew scheduling problem over typical approaches, making it well-suited to practice real-time decision support in railway crew scheduling.},

Traditional local search-based metaheuristic algorithms, such as adaptive neighborhood search (ANS) and variable neighborhood descent (VND), mainly focus on optimizing the current solution without considering potential long-term consequences, which may easily get stuck in local optima and limit the overall performance. Thus, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-network-based metaheuristic algorithm (MDQN-MA) for NRP to harness the strengths of various metaheuristics. Each agent encapsulates a metaheuristic algorithm, where its available actions represent different perspectives of the problem environment. By combining their strengths and various perspectives, these agents can work collaboratively to navigate and search for a broader range of potential solutions effectively. Furthermore, to improve the performance of an individual agent, we model its neighborhood search as a Markov Decision Process model and integrate a deep Q-network to consider long-term impacts for its neighborhood sequential decision-making. The experimental results clearly show that an individual agent in MDQN-MA can outperform ANS and VND, and multiple agents in MDQN-MA even perform better, achieving the best results among metaheuristic algorithms on the Second International Nurse Rostering Competition dataset.},
